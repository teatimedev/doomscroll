# Doomscroll

A TikTok-style video feed in a pane beside Claude Code. It opens when Claude starts working, plays while Claude works, swipes to the next video with your mouse wheel, and pauses the moment Claude is done: *Claude's done. Back to work.*

It is a [Claude Code mod](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins/mods/overview): a plugin of function hooks that draws its own pane. The video is real video, decoded with ffmpeg and drawn with the kitty graphics protocol, at 30 frames a second, with sound.

## What you get

- **A For You feed.** About 70 creators across comedy, memes, slop and oddly satisfying videos, animals, sports, unhinged brand accounts, TV clips and streamers. Each session samples a fresh mix, and you can add your own creators.
- **TikTok's swipe.** The wheel or trackpad over the pane slides to the next video, the way the app does. Upcoming videos download ahead, so the next one is already there.
- **It knows when to stop.** The pane plays while Claude works and pauses when the turn ends. The spinner keeps count: `Sautéing · 4 TikToks deep…`
- **A familiar layout.** The video sits centred with likes, comments, saves and shares beside it, the creator and caption underneath, and a progress bar.

## Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | v2.1.287 or later (mods were introduced in that version) |
| Terminal | [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) or [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). The video uses kitty graphics with Unicode placeholders. Other terminals show a note instead of the picture. |
| OS | macOS or Linux. Windows isn't supported. |
| Tools on your `PATH` | `python3` (3.8 or later), `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`, and `yt-dlp` |

Install the tools:

```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg yt-dlp

# Debian / Ubuntu (other distros: your package manager)
sudo apt install ffmpeg python3 pipx && pipx install yt-dlp
```

Keep `yt-dlp` up to date (`brew upgrade yt-dlp` or `pipx upgrade yt-dlp`), because TikTok changes often.

For the full effect, use Claude Code's fullscreen layout, where the pane docks beside the transcript. Set `"tui": "fullscreen"` in `~/.claude/settings.json`. A dark Claude Code theme (`/theme`) in a dark terminal looks best. The pane takes your terminal's background colour, read from your Ghostty or kitty config.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add teatimedev/doomscroll
claude plugin install doomscroll@doomscroll
```

Or from inside a session: `/plugin install doomscroll --marketplace teatimedev/doomscroll`. Run `/reload-plugins` in a session that is already open.

To try it for one session without installing, clone the repository and run `claude --plugin-dir ./doomscroll`.

## Use it

Ask Claude for something. The pane opens on the right as soon as Claude starts working. On terminals narrower than 144 columns it waits, and `/doomscroll` opens it at any width.

| Do this | To |
| --- | --- |
| Scroll the wheel or trackpad over the pane | Go to the next or previous video |
| Click the pane, then `j` / `k` | Next / previous |
| `p` | Pause or play, including after Claude is done if you want to keep watching |
| `m` | Mute or unmute (remembered) |
| `l` | Like: saves the video to `/doomscroll likes` |
| `o` | Open the video in your browser |
| Esc | Give the keyboard back to the prompt |

Commands:

- `/doomscroll` opens the pane and keeps playing even while Claude is idle
- `/doomscroll off` closes it for the session (closing the pane yourself does the same)
- `/doomscroll mute` / `unmute`
- `/doomscroll add @handle` / `remove @handle` / `creators` manage your own creators
- `/doomscroll likes` lists what you liked, with links
- `/doomscroll doctor` prints what the player found: tools, audio, terminal, feed and recent errors

### Settings

`claude plugin configure doomscroll` (or the `/config` menu) sets:

- **For You mix** (on): the built-in creator mix. Turn it off to see only your own creators.
- **Your creators**: comma-separated handles that are always in the feed
- **Sound on** (on): whether a new session starts with sound
- **Open while Claude works** (on): off means only `/doomscroll` opens the pane

Environment variables: `DOOMSCROLL_MUTED=1` forces silence, `DOOMSCROLL_BACKGROUND=#rrggbb` sets the pane's background when Doomscroll can't read your terminal's, and `DOOMSCROLL_TRANSPORT=file` hands frames to the terminal as files instead of shared memory. Try the last if the picture stays blank.

## What it runs, fetches and stores

A mod runs with your permissions, so here is everything this one does. `claude plugin validate .` lists the same hooks and calls from the source.

- **Runs** `python3 bin/doomscrolld.py` once per interactive terminal session. That player runs `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`, plus `ps` to find your terminal's size. It never runs in `claude -p`, scheduled tasks, the VS Code panel or the Desktop app.
- **Fetches** public creator pages from `tiktok.com` through `yt-dlp`, and the videos and cover images from TikTok's CDN. Nothing is sent anywhere else. There is no account, no login, no analytics and no telemetry.
- **Stores** up to 40 videos, 300 cover images, the feed index and a list of watched video IDs in `~/.cache/doomscroll` (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/doomscroll` if set). Frames pass through POSIX shared memory and a temporary folder, and a Unix socket in `/tmp` carries commands between the hooks and the player. The player removes its socket, frames and temporary folder when the session ends.
- **Reads** your Ghostty or kitty config, only for the background colour.
- **Plays sound** through your default output (CoreAudio on macOS, PulseAudio/PipeWire or ALSA on Linux).
- **Does not** read, store or send your prompts, Claude's answers or your files. The hooks use turns only to know when Claude starts and stops.

## Troubleshooting

- **No pane:** the terminal is under 144 columns (run `/doomscroll`), or Claude Code is older than v2.1.287.
- **"Doomscroll needs ffmpeg, yt-dlp":** install them as above, then run `/doomscroll`, which checks again.
- **"This terminal can't draw video":** use Ghostty or kitty, outside tmux or other multiplexers, which usually block the graphics.
- **Blank picture in Ghostty or kitty:** try `DOOMSCROLL_TRANSPORT=file claude`.
- **"Couldn't reach TikTok":** update `yt-dlp`. TikTok may also be unavailable where you are.
- **Anything else:** `/doomscroll doctor`, then open an issue with its output.

## Develop

```bash
claude --plugin-dir .                        # load it for one session
claude plugin validate --strict .claude-plugin/plugin.json
claude plugin test .                         # the mod's tests, with a fake player
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'   # the player's tests
```

`hooks/register.tsx` draws the pane and drives the player. `bin/doomscrolld.py` is the player: feed, downloads, decoding, the swipe animation and audio. `types/index.d.ts` declares the state the pane draws from.
